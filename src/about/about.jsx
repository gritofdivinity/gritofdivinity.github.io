    <h1>Project Goal</h1>

        At the crux of our lives, we may start to ask some deep questions. What is life? What is the point? What is right? Is there life after death? And so on... Our response to these questions are important because it leads to how we view the world. This then shapes our character and experience in life. What we decide to see, is what we end up eating. What we eat, is who we are. Who we are, is how we act. And how we act, makes our life. To live a good life, I propose you first need good answers or atleast, know where to get them.

        Now 'good' could mean many things. Depending on the person, good could be what is bad for another person. So, what really is good? Some could say, that good is ultimately subjective, it just depends on the person. Others could tell, there is objective good, everyone can relate. In this project, the meaning of 'good' will be anchored by the worldview of Christianity where good is, essentially, God's way. There are several worldviews, but the project's story will centre around Christianity.

        While tackling questions of life and reality, the project's story will also aim to build a creative world, inspired by Christianity, exploring the supernatural and technology of the future. Overall, the main goal is to share an exciting story that will hook people's interests. In the end, hopefully this project can be used for fun, as a guide to life and, if you will, eventually a stepping stone for Jesus Christ.

        We propose that Christianity is the best answer to the challenges of life and what best explains our world. Jesus Christ is the foundation, a man who lived a trustworthy life, performed various miracles, died, rose from the dead and claimed to be The God. This is the evidence and backbone of Christianity. “If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain… But the fact is, Christ has been raised from the dead” (1 Corinthians).
