        At pivotal moments in life, we may ask deeper questions: What is life? What is the point? What is right? Is there life after death? And so on... Our response to these questions are important because it leads to how we view the world. This in turn, shapes our character and our experience in life. What we decide to see, is what we end up eating. What we eat, is who we become. And who we become, determines the quality of our life. To live a good life, I propose you first need good answers or atleast, know where to get them and or who to trust.

        Now 'good' could mean many things. Something good for one person could be bad for another. Then, is there really anything 'good'? Some say good is ultimately subjective, it changes or adapts depending on the person. Others say "no", there is an objective good, maybe not a lot, but essential ones that everyone can relate to. Despite there being many views on this, in this project, the elusive 'good' will be investigated in the context of Christianity where good can be anchored by a god. Good in Christianity is essentially, what follows God's way. It could be argued that this is similar to how relative good can be defined: "Might makes right". God being a powerful and intelligent being, has, knows and can set what truly is 'good'. Can this standard be trusted, or in the end, is there no true good in the world; are we merely helpless, subjugated by the powers and principalities of the world?

        While tackling questions of life and reality, this project's story will also aim to build a creative world, inspired by Christianity, exploring the supernatural and future technology. Overall, the main goal is to share an exciting story that will hook people's hearts. In the end, hopefully this project can be used for fun, as a guide to life and, if you will, eventually a stepping stone for Jesus Christ.

        We propose that Christianity is the best answer to the challenges of life and what best ultimately explains our world. Jesus Christ is the foundation, a man who lived a trustworthy life, performed various miracles, died, rose from the dead and claimed to be The God. This is the evidence and backbone of Christianity. “If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain… But the fact is, Christ has been raised from the dead” (1 Corinthians).
